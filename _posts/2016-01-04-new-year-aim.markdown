<p>This year is going to be a very important year for me. I am writing this post to remind me of what I have planned for this year.</p>

<p>I will try to maintain this blog on a regular basis and update it with new things that I learn day to day.</p>

<p>The list begins...</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Talk to your loved ones</h2>

<p>Talk to your family members, relatives and friends on a regular basis. Getting out of touch is not the best of feelings.</p>

<!-- <blockquote>The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote> -->

<h2 class="section-heading">Exercise regularly.</h2>

<p>Be motivated to go out and hit the gym. Make no excuses today, you'll regret it later. Make sure to eat the right things to meet your fitness goals.</p>

<blockquote>"Work hard, nothing comes for free."</blockquote>

<span class="caption text-muted">Never stop working hard.</span>

<h2 class="section-heading">Competitive Programming.</h2>

<p>Be consistent on this part. Make sure to be regular on Codechef, SPOJ etc.</p>

<blockquote>"Remember, it is easy to start but difficult to maintain."</blockquote>

<p>Will add more with time.</p>

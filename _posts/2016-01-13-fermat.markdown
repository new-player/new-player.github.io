<p>I was recently working on this SPOJ problem <a href="http://www.spoj.com/problems/TWOSQRS/" target="_blank">TWOSQRS</a>.</p>

<p>Problem: <br><strong>"Given integer n decide if it is possible to represent it as a sum of two squares of integers."</strong></p>

<p>Though this can be solved in a naive way using two loops, there is a theorem which provides answer to this question.
That theorem was given by Fermat.
</p>

<p>In additive number theory, Pierre de Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares states that an odd prime p is expressible as
<strong>p = x&#178; + y&#178;,</strong>

with x and y integers, if and only if
<strong>p &#8801; 1 (mod 4)</strong>

</p>
<p>He gave this statement on 1640 but no proof was given.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Congruence relation</h2>

<p>Consider the expression, <strong>A≡B (mod C)</strong>
<br>This says that A is congruent to B modulo C i.e <strong>A(mod C) = B(mod C)</strong></p>

<p>e.g: 
<strong>-43 ≡-7 (mod 12)</strong> because (-43-(-7))(mod 12) = 0 or -43(mod 12) = -7(mod 12)
</p>

<p>So, considering the equation with x and y as integers: <br>
<strong>p = x&#178; + y&#178;,</strong>
<br>
We know that prime numbers (except 2) are either congurent to 1 modulo 4 (e.g 5, 13, 17 etc) or 3 modulo 4 (e.g 3, 7, 11 etc).
All primes congurent to 1 modulo 4 can be expressed as sum of two squares. Whereas, primes congurent to 3 modulo 4 cannot.
<br>
We can also state that all squares are congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 4.

<h2 class="section-heading">Fermat's two squares theorem</h2>

<p>We can state the theorem in following number of ways.</p>
<p>1) If <strong>p = 4n + 1</strong> is prime in Z, then
<br>
<strong>p = x&#178; + y&#178;</strong> for some x, y &#8714; Z.</p>

<p>2) This theorem has an easy converse:
If <strong>p = 4n + 3</strong> is a prime in Z, then p cannot be written as a sum of two squares. 

<p>3) A number <strong>p = x<sub>1</sub><sup>p<sub>1</sub></sup> x<sub>2</sub><sup>p<sub>2</sub></sup> . . . x<sub>m</sub><sup>p<sub>m</sub></sup></strong> (prime factorisation of p) can be represented as the sum of two squares if every prime of the form 4k +3 have even degree.
</p>
<p>
Lets try 3<sup>2</sup> + 10<sup>2</sup> = 109 (prime number with 4k+1 form.)
<br>109 mod 4 ≡ 1
<br>
Lets try one more, 7<sup>2</sup> + 7<sup>2</sup> = 98 = 2<sup>1</sup> 7<sup>2</sup>
<br>7 is a 4k+3 prime and has even power.
</p>

<p>Two Steps. Firstly generate prime numbers using <a href="Sieve of Eratosthenes" target="_blank">Sieve of Eratosthenes</a>.
<br>Then for each test case check for all prime factors in 4k+3 form if they occur even number of times. Show the output accordingly.
